                   <p>Over the years, the series has introduced some exceptional characters like protagonists Gon Freecss and his friend </br> Killua Zoldyck. Furthermore, there are plenty of individuals that have performed feats that make them some of the </br> strongest fighters in anime.

            <p><em><strong>Updated on July 6th, 2021, by Richard Keller: </strong></em>Hunter X Hunter <em>is typical of other </em>shonen <em>anime. Its main protagonist</br> is a young adolescent who does whatever he can to become a member of a Hunter group. What makes it</br> different than other series is 
            the unique way its characters are portrayed and how well they control their </em>Nens <em></br>to obtain their powers.</em></p>

              <p>In general, the Chimera Ants aren't that powerful. They're certainly voracious and </br> eat anything in their path. That includes humans. Particularly those with unique powers.</br>Hence, the reason these colonies can gain the powers they need.</p>
              <p>Some groups of Chimera Ants have become so powerful due to their devouring </br> that they've established a human-like form. As a result of this, they are one of </br> the first set of magical beasts that are considered for quarantine.</p>

              <img width="735" height="375" src="img/gon-freecs-holding-hunter-license-from-hunter-x-hunter.avif"></br> </br>
              <p>Hunter X Hunter's protagonist, Gon Freeces, is a powerful young man. He has </br> the Nen of Enchantment, which enhances his strength and allows him to rapidly heal </br> from injuries. Unfortunately, these powers are muted due to his lack of responsibility.</p>
              <p>Like other pre-teens, Gon is more concerned about his ego. He wants to gain as </br>much power as possible in little time. Thus, he recklessly uses his abilities, </br>especially when he's angry. He could be an amazingly useful Hunter if he had some control.</p></br>

              <img src="img/Killua-Cropped.avif"></br></br>
              <p>Gon's friend, Killua Zoldyck, is similar in personality to Marvel's Wolverine. On </br> one side of the coin, this Hunter X Hunter personality is a one-person killing </br> machine. On the other side, he's incredibly loyal and does what he can to save his friends.</p></br>
              <p>For instance, Killua was able to utilize his sibling's Nen of healing to cure a dying.</br>He has also pushed himself in battles against the Chimera Ants and the video game </br><em>Greed Island</em>. Though his power to convert his aura's energies into electricity is</br> strong, it's his dedication that is Killua's true strength</p></br>

The middle finger chain is used to </br> incapacitate others. Kurapika's little finger shouldn't be underestimated. The chain </br>on this one can stab at an enemy's heart.</p>

              <p>This is a useful tool as long as he can withstand the hurt. From this Nen, he's created </br>a miniature sun that burns anyone around him. On top of this, Feitan is incredibly swift.</br> So much so that he can leave an afterimage of himself during battle.</p>

        </br></br></br></br><p>Zeno Zoldyck may be old but that doesn’t stop him from being one of the most</br> lethal assassins in Hunter x Hunter. His physical strength far exceeds his age. </br>Additionally, Zeno's speed and fighting prowess were enough to put Chrollo Lucifer, </br>the leader of the Phantom Troupe, on the defensive.</p></br>
           <p>As a Transmuter, he manipulates his Nen aura and changes its shape to form </br>dragon-like constructs. While it is mainly an offensive move, Zeno also uses this </br> technique to transport himself and others across vast distances. With his Dragon</br> Dive technique, he can create hundreds of aura dragons that rain down like meteors</br> and cause widespread devastation. Overall, not bad for an old man.</p>

          </div>
          <div class="featured-content">
          </br></br></br></br><p>With an alias like the Grim Reaper, Hisoka Morow is the last person you want to cross</br> paths with. While not exactly evil, Hisoka takes extreme satisfaction in fighting and </br> killing strong opponents. As a former member of the Phantom Troupe, Hisoka ranked</br> third in terms of pure physical strength.</p>
          <p>His Nen ability is the versatileBungee Gum, which gives his aura the properties of </br>rubber and gum. Along with his other ability of Texture Surprise, he can recreate </br> missing limbs and simulate the appearance of human skin. In the manga, Hisoka </br>manages to bring himself back to life after losing a match against Chrollo. </br>Considering that Nen becomes stronger after death, this character's threat level</br> has never been higher.</p></br>

          <p>As the current head of the Zoldyck family, Silva is a dangerous man. Much like his </br>son Killua, he is immune to even the most lethal poisons and can perform </br>superhuman feats. One example is how he jumped from the sky and literally got the</br> drop on a Chimera Ant squadron leader, crushing its head with a single blow.</p></br>
          <p>Silva has also defeated a member of the Phantom Troupe, further supporting that he </br>is not to be taken lightly. In terms of his Nen ability, he is an Emitter and a Transmuter</br> with some expertise as an Enhancer. Using his Nen, Silva converts his aura into </br>large orbs of destructive energy.</p>

          <div class="featured-content" ></br></br></br></br>
          <p>As the leader of the Phantom Troupe, Chrollo is one of the strongest characters in </br>Hunter x Hunter. He fought both Silva and Zeno while holding back and still survived. </br>This speaks volumes of his power. Even Zeno admits that, if Chrollo fought seriously, </br>even he would have trouble defeating him.</p></br>
          <p>As a Specialist, Chrollo is a powerful Nen user who removes other's abilities and </br> uses them as his own. In the past, he could only use one ability at a time. In the </br>manga, he overcomes this weakness and can use two abilities simultaneously.</br> Chrollo is also the first character to mortally wound Hisoka.</p></br></br></br>

          <p>From the moment that Shaiapouf and the other Royal Guards were born, they possessed </br>incredible power. In a short period, he developed an aura output that surpassed even </br>that of Isaac Netero, the chairman of the Hunter Association. Shaiapouf possesses</br> immense physical strength and can run and fly at supersonic speeds. His powers</br> include using scale dust to hypnotize humans, turning people into Chimera Ants,</br> and even bestowing Nen abilities onto others.</p>
          <p>Shiaiapouf can also create copies of himself, decreasing in size with every copy he </br>makes. By creating thousands of miniature duplicates, he can infiltrate even the</br> most secure locations and spy on his enemies without detection.</p>

          <p>In terms of both appearance and power, Menthuthuyoupi is nothing short of a </br>monster. Unlike other human-Chimera Ant hybrids, he is a fusion between a Chimera Ant </br>and a Magical Beast. This gives him the unique ability to control and modify any part </br>of his body. He can grow extra arms and eyes, create animal wings to fly, and morph </br>his limbs into blades.</p>
          <p>When enraged, Youpi pressurizes and stores his aura to gather large quantities of</br> energy. Once he reaches his limit, he unleashes the power in a massive explosion.</br> After learning to control his rage, Youpi channels it into a new and more powerful</br> transformation that easily overpowers his enemies.</p>

          <p>The character's Nen ability allows them to summon different types of puppets. </br>They either heal wounds through advanced surgery or take control of others.</br> Neferpitou’s desire to serve Chimera Ant King Meruem is so strong that even after</br> their death, one of their Nen's puppets continued to exist. By manipulating their corpse, </br>the puppet allowed Neferpitou to continue fighting for the sake of protecting Meruem.</p>

After his friend Kite is captured and killed by the Chimera Ants,</br> he becomes consumed by revenge. This changes not just his personality but his </br>aura as well. After confronting Neferpitou, who was responsible for killing Kite,</br> Gon made a Nen Contract to increase his strength.</p>
          <p>By sacrificing his lifeforce and natural talents, his body matured to a state where he </br>could beat Neferpitou. As an adult, Gon becomes just as powerful as Meruem. </br>As a result, Neferpitou is powerless to stop him from crushing his head in just </br>two blows.</p>

          <p>As chairman of the Hunter Association, Netero spent years training both his body</br> and his Nen ability to their peaks. In his prime, he was considered the most powerful</br> Hunter and Nen user in the world. Netero is also the fastest character, surpassing </br>even Meruem's speed, despite being over 100 years old.</p>
          
          <p>His Nen ability allows him to summon the 100-Type Guanyin Bodhisattva. This </br>construct unleashes over 1000 devastating blows in under a minute. Netero's most</br> powerful move, the Zero Hand, drains his life force to fire a beam of immense destructive </br>energy. Although he may have lost against Meruem, he is the first and only person to</br> make him experience true fear.</p>

          <p>From the moment of his birth, Meruem was already more powerful than any other </br>character in Hunter x Hunter. He is extremely intelligent, able to process thousands </br>of possible scenarios in mere seconds, and was strong enough to push back against</br> the hands of Netero’s 100-Type Guanyin Bodhisattva.</p>
          <p>Meruem's body was also durable enough to allow him to survive the equivalent of a</br> nuclear explosion, although it did reduce him to a near-death state. He has the power</br> to become stronger by consuming Nen users and obtaining their abilities in the process. </br>He displayed this when he absorbed Shaiapouf's and Youpi’s powers, which he uses</br> on a more advanced scale.</p>
