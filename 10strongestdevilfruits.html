                            <img src="img/Gomu-Gomu-No-Mi-and-Uo-Uo-No-Mi-fruits-in-One-Piece.avif" width="780" height="400" alt="Soul-Society-Bleach-Thousand-Year-Blood-WAr"></br>
                        </br><p class="heading_excerpt">With the immense popularity of the Wano arc in the One Piece anime, the hype is at an all-time high, as viewers are watching Kaido and Luffy face off in what has been referred to as "roof piece" by fans.</p>
                            <p class="heading_excerpt">Eiichiro Oda has created a vast world with countless abilities born from devil fruit. It is quite entertaining to reminisce about the many unique powers that have been shown over the course of a thousand episodes. From every devil fruit that has been revealed so far in the series, these seem to stand out as the strongest.
                            </p></br>
                            
                            
                        </br></br><h2 id="h-10-lille-barro">10. Magu Magu No Mi</h2></br></br>
                            <img width="780" height="400" src="img/Magu-Magu-no-Mi.avif"></br></br>
                            <p> Sakazuki Akainu’s devil fruit has been referenced as being the devil fruit with the highest offensive capabilities in the world of One Piece.</p>
                            <p>Being a Navy Admiral, Akainu certainly has powerful haki and skill as a fighter, but his devil fruit would be powerful for anyone possessing it. His lava is hot enough to burn through fire, and so it complicates close combat situations for opponents. Put it this way, If Usopp had the Magu Magu no Mi, he’d be in contention for the strongest straw hat.</p>
                            
                        </br></br><h2 id="h-9-byakuya-kuchiki">9. Goro Goro No Mi</h2></br></br>
                            <img width="780" height="400" alt="Hunter X Hunter Strongest Characters" 
                            src="img/One-Piece-Enel.avif"></br></br>
                            <p>The power to control lighting is overpowered in itself. Being able to turn into lightning is even more impressive. Enel was the first character in the series to eliminate almost all the Straw Hat Pirates like flies.</p>
                            <p>He truly felt like a god and the only reason he lost was due to a poor matchup with Luffy. If a character with a powerful set of armament haki possessed the Goro Goro no Mi, then even the Navy Admirals would tremble in fear.</p>                             
                        </br></br><h2 id="h-8-shunsui-kyoraku">8. Pika Pika No Mi</h2></br></br>
                            <img width="780" height="400" alt="Hunter X Hunter Strongest Characters" 
                            src="img/Pika-Pika-no-Mi.avif"></br></br>
                            <p>Admiral Kizaru’s devil fruit is actually very similar to Enel’s, but instead of morphing into lightning, he turns into light. In a way this is even more devastating than lightning because it is faster.</p>
                            <p>The Pika Pika no Mi is diverse as it allows its owner to essentially teleport, cause giant explosions, and even summon a light sword. Kizaru took out the entire worst generation with his devil fruit and didn’t even need to try. He would have murdered all the Straw Hats if Silvers Rayleigh hadn’t intervened.</p>                            
                            <h2 id="h-7-kenpachi-zaraki">7.Zushi Zushi No Mi                            </br></br>
                                <img width="780" height="400" alt="Hunter X Hunter Strongest Characters" 
                                src="img/Fujitora.avif"> </br></br>
                                <p>The end of the Dressrosa arc revealed just how destructive Admiral Fujitora’s fruit could be if he went all out. With the power to manipulate gravity, Fujitora could devastate an entire region.</p>
                                <p>The Zushi Zushi no Mi can summon a meteor from space. Fujitora can increase gravity to the extent that he creates a crater in the ground. There aren't many paramecia devil fruits that can be placed in the same caliber as a gravity fruit.</p>
                            </br><h2 id="h-6-sosuke-aizen">6. Uo Uo No Mi - Model: Seiryu
                            </h2></br></br>
                                 <img width="780" height="400" alt="Hunter X Hunter Strongest Characters" 
                                 src="img/Dragon-Kaido-in-One-Piece.avif"></br></br>
                                 <p>In terms of power, mythical zoan devil fruits are arguably the greatest class of all. At the pinnacle stand only a handful and Kaido's dragon fruit is certainly one of them.</p>
                                 <p>Turning into a dragon is an incredibly powerful ability as it grants high defense but also an insane offensive capacity. In his transformed state, Kaido was able to destroy an entire mountain with his blast breath. His devil fruit plays a big role in why he is considered the world’s strongest creature.</p>
                                
                                 <h2 id="h-5-gerard-valkyrie">5.Ope Ope No Mi</h2></br>
                                <img width="780" height="400" alt="Hunter X Hunter Strongest Characters" 
                                src="img/One-Piece-Law-Ope-Ope-no-Mi.avif"></br></br>
                                <p>Perhaps one of the most complicated fruits in One Piece, the Ope Ope no Mi has many uses. It allows for its owner to manipulate a limited spherical space in any desired way.</p>
                                <p>Trafalgar Law often likes to use his fruit to detach peoples’ limbs from their bodies. He has displayed massive feats, such as slicing through an entire facility, and can even teleport within his fruit’s space. His fruit makes him one of the most powerful One Piece supernovas.</p>

                            </br></br><h2 id="h-4-ichibe-huosube">4. Hobi Hobi No Mi</h2></br>
                                <img width="780" height="400" alt="Hunter X Hunter Strongest Characters" 
                                src="img/Sugar_Little_Black_Bears.avif"></br></br>
                                <p>During the Dressrosa arc, many powerful warriors were defeated instantaneously by a small girl. Her power allowed her to transform anyone into an obedient toy with a simple touch from her hand. It may be a ridiculous power, but it certainly has a useful effect.</p>
                                <span class="related-single">RELATED: 
                                    <a class="bc-title-link" href="10MostRidiculousDevilFruitPowersRanked.html" title="10 Most Ridiculous Devil Fruit Powers Ranked">10 Most Ridiculous Devil Fruit Powers Ranked</a></span></br>
                                <p>The Hobi Hobi no Mi is overpowered as long as its ability is performed on an unsuspecting opponent. Kaido’s haki, for example, would likely be strong enough to overcome such an effect, but if he was caught by surprise, he might be done for. As long as it’s used in a stealthy manner, this fruit is quite overpowered.</p>

                            </br></br><h2 id="h-3-genryusai-shigekuni-yamamoto">3. Gura Gura No Mi</h2></br></br>
                                <img width="780" height="400" alt="Hunter X Hunter Strongest Characters" 
                                src="img/Gura-Gura-no-Mi.avif"></br></br>
                                <p>Whitebeard had the power to destroy the world with his devil fruit. The Navy had to assemble its 3 admirals, all its vice admirals, and its shichibukai to stand a chance against the Whitebeard Pirates.</p>
                                <p>The Gura Gura no Mi creates earthquakes, but its ability can be used on more than just the ground. Whitebeard was able to quake the air itself and tilt the sea. It is one of the greatest One Piece devil fruits in combat, and doesn’t seem to require much skill to use. Once Blackbeard acquired the Gura Gura no Mi as his second devil fruit, he was immediately able to use its destructive capabilities.</p>


                            </br></br><h2 id="h-2-ichigo-kurosaki">2. Gomu Gomu No Mi</h2></br></br>
                                <img width="780" height="400" alt="Hunter X Hunter Strongest Characters" 
                                src="img/Gomu-Gomu-no-Mi.avif"></br></br>
                                <p>Luffy's devil fruit always seemed to excel due to Luffy’s own will and mastery of it. The fruit itself was never thought to be one of the greatest in the series, but rather an extension of the best character in One Piece.</p>
                                <p>Recently, it was revealed in the manga that Luffy's devil fruit is actually called the Hito Hito no Mi, Model: Nika, and possesses a significant amount of power. It’s still unclear how much Luffy will be able to do with his awakening, but he defeated Kaido which is a massive feat in itself.</p>

                            </br></br><h2 id="h-1-yhwach">1. Yami Yami No Mi</h2></br></br>
                                <img width="780" height="400" alt="Hunter X Hunter Strongest Characters" 
                                src="img/Yami-Yami-no-Mi.avif"></br></br>
                                <p>Blackbeard’s devil fruit can create a darkness that pulls everything in and destroys it. He displayed some of these abilities when he fought Ace.</p>
                                <p>The Yami Yami no Mi's true strength lies in its ability to nerf other devil fruits. Even when fighting against Whitebeard, Blackbeard was able to negate the quakes caused by the Gura Gura no Mi. This makes Blackbeard a huge problem for any devil fruit user that may battle him in the future. He will certainly be one of the final villains in the series.</p>
