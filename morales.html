                            <p>The first trailer for Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse shows a Miles Morales who has come into his own as his world's premiere wallcrawler.</p>
                            <img src="img/across-the-spider-verse-indian-spider-man.avif" width="900" height="500" alt="Soul-Society-Bleach-Thousand-Year-Blood-WAr"></br>
                        </br><p class="heading_excerpt">The first trailer for Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse has landed, bringing with it a first look at the upcoming animated sequel's mighty horde of Spider-People. However, at the heart of the new film and the heart of the trailer is Shameik Moore's returning Miles Morales, the one and only Spider-Man of his world. The previous film in the series, Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse, saw Miles take on the mantle of Spider-Man after his Earth's Peter Parker was killed in battle. Miles received guidance from Peter B. Parker and Gwen Stacy when they arrived in his world from their own universes, though he struggled to get to grips with his new powers and new responsibilities.</p>
                            <p class="heading_excerpt">By the end of Into the Spider-Verse, Miles had settled into his new role and was seen becoming a more confident Spider-Man as his multiversal counterparts returned to their realities. Now, it looks like Miles has continued to mature and grapple with what it means to be Spider-Man. The first trailer for Across the Spider-Verse introduces a Miles Morales that appears far more comfortable and assured in his crime-fighting, is willing to stand up to his fellow Spider-Men and has a stronger sense of himself.</p>

                            <p>While the new Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse trailer dazzles with a look at the countless Spider-People of various realities, the multiverse-spanning scale is underpinned by a conversation between Miles and his mother, Rio Morales (Lauren VÃ©lez). The trailer opens with Rio approaching her son, talking to him about growing up and the importance of remembering where he came from. Their discussion plays out over clips from the previous film, as well as a few shots from Across the Spider-Verse. These include sequences showing Miles in his regular Spider-Man duties, swinging through the city and saving civilians. The message is clear: this is not the meek, uncertain Miles of Into the Spider-Verse. He's grown up and embraced life as a lone Spider-Man. </p>
                            <p>
                                As if to drive the point home, the trailer shows Miles easily catching a car that's been thrown through the air in his webbing. He appears to be every bit the superhero Peter Parker once was on his Earth. However, that's not to say he won't end up getting in over his head. In fact, his newfound confidence in his capabilities as Spider-Man might be the only thing that enables Miles to keep going when he finds himself in the difficult position of having to stand against all the Spider-People in the multiverse.</p>
                            <p>While Into the Spider-Verse saw Miles facing off against traditional villains, Across the Spider-Verse pits him against his fellow spider-themed heroes. Oscar Isaac's Spider-Man 2099, aka Miguel O'Hara, is seen leading the charge in a Spider-Man showdown with Miles. The sight of Miles fighting Miguel and hundreds of other Spider-People is set against his mother's words, as she worries that the rest of the world "won't look out for you like us." She tells Miles to promise her that he will look after himself. In these moments, the trailer tells its audience exactly where Miles finds himself this time around. Unlike last time, he's not going to have a whole team of allies on whom he can rely. However, this Miles is more prepared than ever to fight his own battles.</p>

                            <p>Despite being in his own movie, Miles Morales is not technically a part of the MCU at the moment. Across the Spider-Verse isn't even guaranteed to change this, considering this film is animated and won't necessarily be canon to Earth-616 and the current MCU. Despite this, it's pretty clear that time is running out for Marvel to introduce the teen in an MCU live-action movie. There are a lot of issues forming that may mess up his involvement in the beloved Marvel universe.

                            </p>
                            <p>Because Miles Morales has been featured throughout Marvel's comics, games, and animated films, he already has a loyal fanbase. The animated Spidey films, especially, are becoming more beloved among Marvel fans. With that said, as fans grow more attached and fond of animated Miles, it becomes more likely that live-action Miles won't perform as well. On top of this, as the Spider-Verse movies progress, they are constantly covering more ground when it comes to Miles as a character. With his arc already being explored thoroughly, the MCU will be left with mere scraps to work with. If Marvel waits any longer to introduce the next Spider-Man as part of the MCU, audience enthusiasm will likely decrease.</p>
                             <p> It seems that the wait for Across the Spider-Verse is almost over. But fans can agree that it's been too long. Miles Morales needs his MCU debut soon, or his introduction will probably fall flat. Any more procrastination regarding this character could be detrimental to the franchise.</p>
