                            <h1 class="heading_title">The MCU Is Running Out of Time To Introduce Miles Morales</h1></br>
                            <p>With Across the Spider-Verse coming soon, it’s clear that Marvel’s time is almost up. The success of Miles Morales' MCU debut is hanging on by a web.</p>
                            <img src="img/miles-morales-across-spider.avif" width="900" height="500" alt="Soul-Society-Bleach-Thousand-Year-Blood-WAr"></br>
                        </br><p class="heading_excerpt">The Marvel Cinematic Universe is an extraordinarily complex system with loads of characters and storylines to explore. There is seemingly no shortage of movies to look forward to within the MCU as the next decade of movies is planned out. But there's a big problem brewing with the upcoming Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse and the very-procrastinated MCU debut of Miles Morales</p>
                            <p class="heading_excerpt">Miles Morales is a character who's starred in plenty of Spider-Man comics and games. Simply put, he's a teenager that idolizes Spider-Man very much. Not only is he a Spidey fan, but he's also friends with Peter Parker. Throughout their friendship, Peter leads Miles on a journey to help better society with volunteer work and even toward superhero status. It's fair to say he's in line to become the next Spider-Man. This is complete with the powerful spider bite and all.</p>

                        </br></br><h2 id="h-10-lille-barro">Across the Spider-Verse Will Continue Miles Morales' Story</h2></br></br>
                            <p>In 2018, Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse marked the first feature film to feature Miles Morales. Despite being in plenty of other Marvel media, this is really where he becomes an integral part of the Spider-Man universe. </p>
                            <p>Into the Spider-Verse follows Morales, who, at the time, is just an ordinary teenager from the New York City borough of Brooklyn. His life becomes pretty chaotic after a subway ride leaves him with a nasty bug bite. However, this is not an ordinary bug; it's a radioactive spider. As seen before in the Spider-Man universe, after the radioactive spider chomps on the teenager, he becomes more powerful than his peers. While developing such Spidey powers, he's lucky enough to meet Peter Parker. He realizes that he, a Spider-Human hybrid, is not alone in the world. But this isn't necessarily a good thing, as the unlucky teen is thrust into battle, where he meets plenty of interuniversal versions of his hero, Spider-Man. The sequel to this movie is coming soon with Across the Spider-Verse. It's set to put Morales up against the other Spidey people, and he must fight to save himself and the multiverse yet again.</p>
                            <p>Spider-Man has always been a very popular franchise for Marvel. The kid behind the mask tends to gather the love of fans for plenty of reasons. Miles Morales is no exception to this. Both Tom Holland's Peter Parker and Miles are often written as teens in high school, which makes them more relatable for a younger audience. Miles provides a fresh and diverse take on the Spider-Man character. He's not only the first Spidey of color but was also granted powers that Peter Parker doesn't have. People rightfully love this kid.</p>

                            <img width="780" height="400" alt="Hunter X Hunter Strongest Characters" 
                            src="img/spider-man-across-the-spider-verse-poster-spider-people-cropped.avif"></br></br>
                            <p>Despite being in his own movie, Miles Morales is not technically a part of the MCU at the moment. Across the Spider-Verse isn't even guaranteed to change this, considering this film is animated and won't necessarily be canon to Earth-616 and the current MCU. Despite this, it's pretty clear that time is running out for Marvel to introduce the teen in an MCU live-action movie. There are a lot of issues forming that may mess up his involvement in the beloved Marvel universe.

                            </p>
                            <p>Because Miles Morales has been featured throughout Marvel's comics, games, and animated films, he already has a loyal fanbase. The animated Spidey films, especially, are becoming more beloved among Marvel fans. With that said, as fans grow more attached and fond of animated Miles, it becomes more likely that live-action Miles won't perform as well. On top of this, as the Spider-Verse movies progress, they are constantly covering more ground when it comes to Miles as a character. With his arc already being explored thoroughly, the MCU will be left with mere scraps to work with. If Marvel waits any longer to introduce the next Spider-Man as part of the MCU, audience enthusiasm will likely decrease.</p>
                             <p> It seems that the wait for Across the Spider-Verse is almost over. But fans can agree that it's been too long. Miles Morales needs his MCU debut soon, or his introduction will probably fall flat. Any more procrastination regarding this character could be detrimental to the franchise.</p>
                        
                             <p><em>To see what Miles has been up to, Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse swings into theaters on June 2, 2023.</em></p>
